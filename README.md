# Teeth Classification
# Overview
- Uses CNNs and MobileNetV2 to accurately classify dental images into disease categories.
- Leverages deep learning techniques for precise detection and diagnosis of dental conditions.
- Features a Streamlit web app for seamless image uploads and real-time predictions.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Teeth Dataset," which includes images categorized into the following disease classes:

- CaS (Caries)
- CoS (Crown)
- Gum (Gum Diseases)
- MC (Mouth Cancers)
- OC (Oral Cancers)
- OLP (Oral Lichen Planus)
- OT (Other Types)

# Features
- Data Augmentation: Techniques used to increase the dataset size and variability.
- Model Architecture: Custom CNN architectures designed for classifying dental images.
- Fine Tuning: Transfer learning of MobileNet V2 and tuning it to be used in Teeth diseases classification.
- Evaluation: Metrics and methods used to evaluate model performance on training, validation, and test sets.
- Visualization: Tools for visualizing images and their classifications, including grid-based displays of example images.

# Installation
